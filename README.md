## Problem Statment

The conventional public buses that we are used to, run at fixed routes with fixed schedules. This however limits the efficiency of operation. As a proof, all of the major bus operators in India are incurring net loss in operations. Further, the high operational costs prohibit development of public transport in sub-urban areas such as tier-2 cities and towns. This very short project is based on this idea only in which we come up with the solution of replacing conventional transport with demand responsive transport. The process is much like how you book a cab or a train ticket. You specify your boarding and destination stations. The operator then decides to run a bus on the route based on realtime consumer demands. This maximises operational efficiency which results in significantly lower operations costs as well as improved passenger experience. We intent to carefully fine-tune the design choices to reflect the needs of an Indian passenger for best experience.
